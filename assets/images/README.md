# Images Directory

Place your images here and reference them in your posts and pages using:

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/your-image.jpg)
```

## Recommended Image Formats

- **JPEG** - For photos and complex images
- **PNG** - For images with transparency or simple graphics
- **SVG** - For logos and scalable graphics
- **WebP** - For optimized web images (modern browsers)

## Image Optimization Tips

1. Compress images before uploading
2. Use appropriate dimensions (avoid oversized images)
3. Consider using responsive images for different screen sizes
4. Add descriptive alt text for accessibility

## Folder Organization

You can organize images in subfolders:

```
assets/images/
├── posts/          # Images for blog posts
├── pages/          # Images for static pages
├── profile/        # Profile pictures
└── projects/       # Project screenshots
```
