# Hello, I'm Efren! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Kueski** and **IEEE Volunteer** passionate about building scalable ML platforms, cloud architecture, and mentoring engineering teams. I specialize in MLOps, fintech innovation, and engineering leadership.

Currently, I lead ML operations and infrastructure at Mexico's largest online consumer lender, while actively contributing to the IEEE community and mentoring the next generation of engineers.
